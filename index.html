            Joshua deLorimier is a new media artist, software 
            developer and interactive motion graphics designer. 
            Due to his passion for the real-time integration of 
            sound and music, Joshua has crafted a career around 
            the design of audio reactive visuals and artwork for 
            live stage concert situations. Joshua has designed and 
            performed visuals with acclaimed musicians spanning
            multiple genres. He creates custom software designs with 
            mathematical algorithms to produce immersive interactive 
            experiences with the accompanying music. He is trained 
            formally in motion graphics and film editing from 
            Wilmington University in Wilmington, DE and Video 
            Symphony in Burbank, CA.

            Joshua works fluently with 3D packages and 2D design tools. 
            He builds custom modified software designed specifically to 
            handle his unique and meticulous workflow. Joshua believes 
            that the tools used in the production of creative work are 
            as influential to the process as the artist themselves. 
            In the last year, he has expanded his portfolio with 
            numerous works including an installation entitled 
            “Algorithmic Structures” which was displayed at a local
            venue in Newark, Delaware. Joshua has recently begun working 
            on mobile platforms and is currently concentrating on
            developing virtual reality software.
